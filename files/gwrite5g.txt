GRAM WRITE TEST
===============
 
This test is used to check the basic
functionality of the FinalGROM 99.
 
This test writes and checks half of
the GRAM bytes from each GROM and
reports any bad writes.
 
If a given GROM can write correctly to
the upper half of each GRAM, the
program displays the GROM number
followed by "OK".
 
In case of a write or read error, only
the GROM number is displayed.  An
additional error message at the bottom
of the screen remains there until the
test is terminated.
 
Each GROM writes to GRAM addresses
>7xxx, >9xxx, >Bxxx, >Dxxx, >Fxxx to
increment their contents and to check
if the increment can be read back.
  
This test runs in a loop.  You may run
it unsupervised for prolonged periods
to see if the FinalGROM 99 runs
stably.  Upon return, the bottom of
the screen will tell you if there were
any errors.
