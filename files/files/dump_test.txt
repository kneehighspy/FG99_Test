ROM DUMP TEST
=============
 
This test is used to check the basic
functionality of the FinalGROM 99.
 
This single-bank test shows the sum of
all words in RAM on screen.  The
program then increases each word by 1
and dumps itself, including the
increased RAM words, onto SD card.
 
After the dump has completed, check
the Dump Test image on the SD card to
see the increased words.  Or, reset
and restart the dump test, which
should show the previous sum increased
by >800.
