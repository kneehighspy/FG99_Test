GROM TEST
=========
 
This test is used to check the basic
functionality of the FinalGROM 99.
 
The test will run through each GROM
and compare various addresses against
known values.
 
If there run completes without read
errors, the program displays "OK"
after the GROM number.
 
In case of a read error, "BAD" is
shown after the GROM number, and an
additional message at the bottom of
the screen is shown.  The message
remains on the screen until the
program is terminated.
 
Because the check code is spread out
more, the likelyhood of bad reads
crashing the TI 99 might be higher.
 
This test runs in a loop.  You may run
it unsupervised for prolonged periods
to see if the FinalGROM 99 runs
stably.  Upon return, the bottom of
the screen will tell you if there were
any errors.
 
(In case of crashes, note that it may
*still* have been the TI 99 that has
failed.)
